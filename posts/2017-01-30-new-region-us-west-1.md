We've added `us-west-1` to our list of supported AWS regions, bringing the total number of supported regions to **nine**.

<!--more-->

AWS [recently announced](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2016/11/aws-lambda-available-in-us-west-n-california/) Lambda support in their US West (N. California) region. As a result, we are happy to announce that it is now available in Convox.

Today, you can install Convox in any of the following regions:

- ap-northeast-1
- ap-southeast-1
- ap-southeast-2
- eu-central-1
- eu-west-1
- us-east-1
- us-east-2
- **us-west-1**
- us-west-2

You can see the full list of supported regions at any time [in our documentation](https://convox.com/docs/supported-aws-regions).

## How to install

You can install a Rack in us-west-1 by selecting it from the drop-down menu on the "Add a Rack" page in your [Convox console](https://{{ site.console_host }}/). For details, see the [Rack install documentation](https://convox.com/docs/installing-a-rack/).
